<h1>Movie Genre's That Have Fallen Out Of Favor</h1>

		<p class="phead phead1">Film Noir</p>  
		<p class="card">A style or genre of cinematographic film marked by a mood of pessimism, fatalism, and menace. The term was originally applied (by a group of French critics) to American thriller or detective films made in the 1940's and 1950's.  Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key, black-and-white visual style.  </p>

		<p class="phead phead2">Western</p>
		<p class="card">
			<p>
				Once a mainstay of the U.S. film industry, the western has all but disappered from modern movies. Based largely in an idealized historical perspective of primarily the 19th centry old west, the genre has not not aged well due to treatment and presentation of native Americans and other margionalized peoples.
